## Introduction:

Hello! I'm an accomplished Electronic Engineer specializing in circuit design, PCB development, sensor technology, and machine learning applications. Holding a Master of Science in Microsystems and Microelectronics (MEMS) from the prestigious Technology University Hamburg (TUHH), I bring a wealth of expertise to the table.

During my master's studies, I delved deep into cutting-edge projects, including designing operational amplifiers with layouts at 180nm and crafting Serial and Peripheral Interfaces (SPI). My master's thesis showcased my proficiency in applying advanced techniques, as I tackled noise detection on High-Density Point Cloud Data from a White Light Interferometer using deep learning methodologies.

My academic journey extends further back to my Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) from the American International University - Bangladesh (AIUB). Here, I focused on electronics and biomedical signal analysis, culminating in a notable thesis on mapping the Mammalian Purkinje Network on an Electrically Equivalent Circuit.

Throughout my education, I've honed my skills in analog and digital circuitry, conducted extensive research in optoelectronics, computer vision, and machine learning, and gained practical experience in labs ranging from analog and digital circuit labs to EMC labs for crosstalk and CMOS mixed-signal labs.

With a solid foundation in both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience, I'm passionate about leveraging technology to drive innovation and solve complex engineering challenges.
